        <p class="post-excerpt">Splatoon 2 barely peaked my interest when it was announced for the Switch. I skipped the demo Nintendo released a month before the launch, thinking it wasn’t for me with its kiddie aesthetic. Even though I love shooters like Halo and Doom, Splatoon 2 looked too frantic for me to be able to keep up with from the let’s plays I had seen.

        <p class="post-excerpt">The first teaser for the Force Awakens was a mix of emotions for me. Everything was there from sandy landscapes, Stormtroopers, X-Wings, and even an amazing Millennium Falcon sequence with the Star Wars overture blasting in the background. Even when the second trailer was released, I got a little choked up seeing Han and Chewy back on the Falcon. I was convinced that this movie would bring back the child in me that loved the original series.

        <p class="post-excerpt">I vividly remember the first time I used a Macintosh. During a trip to Circuit City to purchase my mother’s iPod Mini, there was a display unit of an iMac G4. Initially it wasn’t the Macintosh that grabbed my attention; instead, it was the looping demo of a game called Nanosaur. I loved dinosaurs as a kid, and still do, so the game instantly pulled me in with its dinosaur theme and stunning graphics.
