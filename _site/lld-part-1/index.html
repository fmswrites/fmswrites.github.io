  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We haven’t been on a vacation in over six years. Other than that one time we had to chaperone Steph’s class field trip to a local museum, god was that a horrible day. Six years of seeing and doing the same thing everyday, and never getting a break from it.</p>

<p>When we were in college we always talked about traveling the world and seeing all the different cultures that were slowing disappearing as technology helped the world become more reachable, but also led newer generations to want to have a more modern lifestyle. Unfortunately, when you graduate from college you don’t get any breaks or freedoms. It’s this vicious circle society created to keep everyone working and not cause the “system” any problems. They tell you “You must go to college to have a successful life,” so you go to college believing that everyone can’t be wrong. As soon as you select a college, you start to collect debt faster than you can imagine. That is where they get you, you can’t have freedom, enjoy life, or take breaks because you have piles of debt. Thanks to all your new debt, you put your dreams aside and get a job because the debt won’t magically disappear.</p>

<p>That is what we had to do, find the first job we could to help get the loan collectors off of our backs. Since Steph had a Bachelors of Science in Humanities, her only option where we lived was to become a teacher. She tried for months to be hired by the university so she could have more time to conduct research or possibly travel the world. Unfortunately, the university went through a massive re-structuring and instead of hiring more teachers to support the increased student body, they laid off about fifteen precent of the faculty and staff. She eventually found a teaching position at a local middle school for sixth grade American History. While she is passionate about history as a subject and the cultures around us, most middle school students just care about who is dating who and trying to figure out a way to run away from their parents. This leaves Steph to essentially become a babysitter instead of a teacher, which means she hates her job like most people in the world.</p>

<p>I on the other hand did what everyone advised me to do when I was thinking about going to college, become a software engineer because I was “good at computers” as many people around me would say. While I liked that field I never truly loved it, but everyone said it would lead to a better life and open new opportunities for me in the future. I figured how can everyone be wrong, I really need to stop thinking that.</p>

<p>After four years of college though, I hated everything related to Software Engineering but of course it was to late, and the debt had already started to come back and haunt me. I had no choice when I graduated other than to accept the first company that offered me a job. Everyone was so proud of me when the Grey-Lee Corporation hired me right out of college, even though they hire almost eighty percent of the graduating class from my college. Where we lived Grey-Lee was the best company to work for and employed almost half of our town. I never understood the appeal of working there, an office job I always saw as something that would suck the life out of you if you stayed in one for too long. Unfortunately though, I didn’t have a choice and wound’t be able to wait any longer before I would have to start paying back my student loans, so I quickly accepted the job.</p>

<p>Steph and I wanted to travel the world and document the disappearing cultures that we would always talk about in our cramped dorm room in college. Our plan was I would photograph all of the people and cities, while Steph would write about all the stories and history the cultures and its people would share. I remember talking for hours at night with Steph in her cramped dorm, while her roommate got high or was having sex, and tried to plan all the places we wanted to go and all the people we wanted to meet. We wrote it all down in this crappy notebook we bought at a gas station that was on campus, and would add to it every nigh.</p>

<p>Now the notebook lives under our bed with my camera and Steph’s audio recorder, all part of our lost dreams of the life we never got a chance to live. And this all leads me to where I am now, sitting in my shared cubicle trying to figure out why I listened to all those people who said this would be a better life for me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I didn’t get home till six that night. My boss asked me to update our servers, which they of course crashed after the update and refused to turn back on. Even though computers are marketed as being incredibly “advanced” and “revolutionary”, they never work like they are suppose to. I honestly believe that after the mid 2000s all the technology that has been created was created solely for the purpose to anger every person on Earth, and at the same time trap them in a never-ending barrage of bugs and subsequent updates that essentially just introduces more bugs.</p>

<p>Luckily Steph had gotten off of work early and picked up Kentucky Fried Chicken for us. While I know how bad KFC is for you, and how it probably isn’t even real chicken, it is something that always makes me smile. When I was a kid and I had a bad day, my mom would always get the family KFC for dinner and no matter how upset I was about the day, it would always make me feel better.</p>

<p>Steph had a pretty bad day, probably a worse day than me trying to fight the Great Server War of 2015. She found out her school district’s budget was being cut and there would be a stronger focus on STEM based courses. This meant that since history isn’t in STEM, none of the humanities are which is why it isn’t a good teaching curriculum, the district was going to cut the number of history teachers they needed. Unfortunately, Steph was going to be one of the teachers they cut and since it was almost the end of the school year, she only had two months to prepare to find a new job.</p>

<p>“Did they even say why?” I asked her.</p>

<p>“Yeah, they actually did for once,” Steph said angrily. “Apparently teaching kids about the fall of the Berlin Wall or the origins of our country isn’t as important as having them learn how to program a fucking computer!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the district understand the importance of teaching the humanities and not just engineering focused courses?” I responded somewhat in shock of this new approach of the school district.</p>

<p>“Richard, the head of district hasn’t even heard about the Great Depression or the fall of the Berlin Wall. The entire board are a bunch of engineers who only know how to code and make fancy Excel spreadsheets that mean absolutely nothing. Their only true concern is with ensuring that whatever numbers get published by the local paper paints them in a good light, even if that means sacrificing the future of every kid in our district.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought of what you will do next?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yeah, you know that rope in the garage? I’m going to get it and hang myself from the chandelier. I always hated that chandelier my mother gave us. I would ask you join me, but we don’t have enough rope for the two of us.”</p>

<p>“Hey you are not leaving me that easy,” I responded jokingly. “On a brighter note, do you remember what we always would talk about at night back in college?”</p>

<p>“Of course, that my roommate was way too loud during sex”</p>

<p>“No no. About us traveling the world and documenting all the disappearing cultures and people?” I said as I reached for a piece of chicken from the KFC bowl.</p>

<p>“Yeah of course I do, it was my idea initially. We had it all planned out, except we never took into account our wonderful pile of debt we collected trying to get through college.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I laughed remembering that we had a student loan bill due this week. “I was bored at work and for some reason I was remembering our plans, do you remember that shitty notebook we would write it all in?”</p>

<p>“You mean that pink one with flowers on it?” she asked half jokingly. “Imagine if we could have turned that into a career and have not been forced to accept the shitty jobs we have now.”</p>

<p>“That was all I could think about today. I got almost no work done, which isn’t really anything new for me.”</p>

<p>Steph grabbed the KFC bowl and the side of potato wedges and walked to the couch outside the kitchen. When I sat down next to her I reached for a potato wedge to find out that Steph had eaten all but one. Those were always my favorite, but when Steph was upset she would always eat them all before I got the chance. It was okay though, she had a rough day, I grabbed the last one and quickly ate it before she could steal it out of my hand.</p>

<p>“Really you had to eat the last one?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You ate them all, and you know they are my favorite” I responded as I grabbed the last piece of chicken from the bowl.</p>

<p>“Well, getting back to our absolutely wonderful life. Unless you’ve been hiding money from me, we are stuck here eating KFC and waking up tomorrow to go to our wonderful jobs.” She said as she moved closer to me and put her head on my chest.</p>

<p>“However, you know what we could do?” Steph asked as she put her arm around me. “We could be as loud as my shitty college roommate since we have this entire apartment to ourselves”</p>

<p>“What about the neighbors downstairs?” I asked remembering the texts we would get from them every night complaining about the noise from our TV, we don’t even have a TV in our apartment.</p>

<p>“Screw them, they can put some headphones on like we have to when they are loud.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Steph woke me up from my dream as she got out of bed to use the bathroom. I rolled over and tried to fall back asleep into the dream I was having. I was dreaming of me and Steph at the Great Wall of China talking to a young couple about their family and their heritage. They invited us to dinner and we were astonished how nice and welcoming they were to complete strangers, something we don’t really feel here in California.</p>

<p>After a few minutes passed I didn’t feel Steph get back into bed. I opened my eyes and saw that the door to the bathroom was closed and light was rushing through the bottom of the door. I rolled back over to look at our alarm clock which was pulsing 1:30am in red.</p>

<p>I yelled out, “Did you fall in or something? I’ve been trying to remember to put the seat back down.”</p>

<p>No answer, so I put on my sweatpants and got up and knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“Honey you okay in there? You fall asleep or something?” I asked. No response so I started to open the door.</p>

<p>“Hun I’m going to come in to make sure you are okay.”</p>

<p>As I opened the door I felt a strong cold breeze hit my face which instantly woke me up. After my eyes adjusted to the blinding light I was amazed at what I was seeing.</p>

<p>Instead of our Solar System shower curtain, which was something Steph always had ever since she was a kid, I saw Step standing in the middle of a stone road completely naked staring into the distance. While I didn’t fully understand what had happened to our bathroom, I grabbed her pajamas from the floor and rushed to her.</p>

<p>“Stephanie! What happened,” I asked as I started to help her put on her clothes.</p>

<p>“I…I…” she uttered as she put her pants on. “What happened to the Solar System?”</p>

<p>As we stood there we tried to digest all of our new surrounding. I took a deep breath and was amazed at how incredible crisp and clean it felt. I no longer smelt all the burning gas or the wretched smell of marijuana, a new “addition” to our city after the last election when it became legal to smoke anywhere. Steph and I never smoked marijuana and we never could stand the smell, which means when we went out we usually try not to stay out too long since the entire city now smells like a dead skunk. It is sad that we can’t even open our windows for fresh air because fresh air no longer exists. Here all of that was gone, and was replaced by clean and crisp air.</p>

<p>Surrounding us were beautiful sharp mountains and blue skies with small clouds floating here and there. It all looked alien to me, I wasn’t use to seeing so much nature at once. Where we live when you look up all you see is tall buildings reaching all the way up to the skies, and cranes everywhere creating more apartment buildings that I could never afford in my lifetime. Here though there were no buildings, no chain restaurants, or protesters stopping traffic. That was all replaced with the majesty of this new place, which started to seem familiar as I looked around more. I turned to Steph and asked.</p>

<p>“Where are we?”</p>

<p>“I…I…I think we are on the Great Wall of China.” she responded as she started to look around more.</p>

<p>“Look” she said as she pointed to a young girl racing to grab her toy car that had gotten away from her.</p>

<p>As the toy passed through our legs and towards our bedroom door, the girl ran around us towards the open door. However, she wasn’t fast enough and the toy car rolled past the door frame and into our bedroom and came to a stop at our bed. Once it had entered our door, the girl stopped and looked around as if though she had forgotten why she was running towards our door. After a few seconds, she ran back to her parents that had been standing near the chest high wall with a slit in it. The father was taking pictures of the wife and looked down to see his daughter missing. As he started to look all around her, she playfully tugged on his shirt and he picked her up and threw her onto his shoulders. The entire family moved closer to the edge and the mother took group selfie of the entire family.</p>

<p>Steph grabbed my hand and lead me towards the nearest opening in the wall. As we got closer her hand became clammy and she gripped my hand harder. At the wall we looked towards the left and right when instantly all of the air was knocked out of me and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</p>

<p>In both directions we saw the wall go on for miles and miles as it weaved and curved around he mountain range.</p>

<p>“My god, you were right, it is the Great Wall!” I said as I turned towards Steph.</p>

<p>“Of course it is. I’m a damn History teacher, I better know what the Great Wall of China looks like.” she said as she smiled at me.</p>

<p>After staring out into the beautiful mount range Steph spoke very quietly to me.</p>

<p>“We should head back, people are starting to stare at us.” She pointed around us as I saw that we were surrounded by tourist. Unlike all of them in their backpacks and proper attire, we were standing there with our pajamas on sticking out like a sore thumb. Past the massive crowd were two security officers jogging towards us.</p>

<p>“Good point,” I said as I looked back towards the door. “Look! The door is still open. We should get out of here before someone catches us.”</p>

<p>“Who would catch us? We are just tourist like all the other people, just dressed a little differently.”</p>

<p>“Either way before the door closes, lets go.” I grabbed her hand and we started to walk towards the door trying to not look at all the people starring at us.</p>

<p>Once inside we turned around and slowly closed the door. Our last image was seeing all the people starring at us slowly loose focus, like the girl chasing after her toy car, and go on about their way. After the door was shut we both fell backwards onto our bed and passed out. The last thing I saw was the alarm clock which still read 1:30AM</p>
