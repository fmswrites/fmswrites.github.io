I vividly remember the first time I used a Macintosh. During a trip to Circuit City to purchase my mother’s iPod Mini, there was a display unit of an iMac G4. Initially it wasn’t the Macintosh that grabbed my attention; instead, it was the looping demo of a game called Nanosaur. I loved dinosaurs as a kid, and still do, so the game instantly pulled me in with its dinosaur theme and stunning graphics.

*Still an amazing game after all this time*

After I played the demo for a while, I finally noticed the Macintosh running the game. I had always thought computers had to be beige or gray metal boxes that were basic. The iMac G4, with its clean white aesthetic and transparent bubble speakers, changed the way I thought about computers forever.

I purchased my first Macintosh a few years later when my Compaq laptop was dying of old age. It took a bit of convincing of my parents to purchase a Macintosh since all of their past computers were simple PCs. Thanks to the Macintosh’s excellent marketing and wide-range of apps, they eventually agreed, and we picked out a [year] black MacBook. The first day I turned it on was amazing. From its cheerful startup chime to the Welcome Video that played when you first booted into Mac OS X Tiger, it was an amazing first experience with a Macintosh. After learning Mac OS X and the iLife/iWork suite of applications, I started to research the Macintosh’s long history. It didn’t take long before the candy colored G3s, and sunflower G4s became computers I wanted to collect.

A few years after that first Macintosh turned on, I was finally able to purchase my first Classic Macintosh during a family trip to Seattle. Growing up in a small town in Florida meant that there wasn’t a huge demand for technology, especially for Apple products. I knew Seattle should have a large selection of used computers floating around at garage sales and on Craigslist. Almost immediately I found a reasonably priced Power Mac G4, not my first choice for a Classic Macintosh, but I wasn’t trying to be picky back then. A few email exchanges later and we purchased the Macintosh from the seller who had been using it as an audio mixing station for a few years.

*Still working to this day*

The Macintosh was in great shape with almost no scratches, and it ran flawlessly. During all of the excitement of finally finding a Classic Macintosh, I had not thought of how I would transport it back to Florida. Shipping was out of the question due to its heavy weight, leaving my only option to be disassembling it and packing all of the parts into our luggage.

Thanks to the modular design of the Power Mac G4, the disassembly was painless and quick, but what came next wasn’t. I worried the entire trip home, from when the baggage handlers tossed the luggage onto the plane, the five-hour flight, and the hour ride home from the airport. The next morning I woke up early and excited to reassemble the computer, hoping that none of it was damaged during the trip. After I put it all back together,  the moment of truth finally came. I pressed the power button, and it instantly lit up followed by the startup chime, marking the beginning of my Classic Macintosh Collection.

After a recent move from Florida to Las Vegas, I was unpacking my collection and trying to decide what to do with all of the Macintoshes. I unpacked one of the iMac G3s and turned it on. Being one of the most recent Macintoshes I had bought before the move, it still had Mac OS 9 installed and a bunch of old software from the previous owner. I played around with it for a while and was reminded of why I loved collecting these classic computers from long before I was a daily Macintosh user. Since I had moved cross country with all these cumbersome and unwieldy Macintoshes, I figured I should do something productive with all of them.

That is where Reviving the Classic comes from. The goal with this website is to document the rich history of the Macintosh through detailed software reviews, repair manuals, and most importantly, retrospectives on the Macintosh platform as a whole. I hope to document a piece of Apple’s history that many of today’s iPad, iPhone, and Watch wearing fans of Apple may not be aware of. Hopefully, this site can be a mix of entertainment and history lessons that everyone can enjoy.
