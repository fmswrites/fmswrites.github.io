The first teaser for the Force Awakens was a mix of emotions for me. Everything was there from sandy landscapes, Stormtroopers, X-Wings, and even an amazing Millennium Falcon sequence with the Star Wars overture blasting in the background. Even when the second trailer was released, I got a little choked up seeing Han and Chewy back on the Falcon. I was convinced that this movie would bring back the child in me that loved the original series.

It was a warm winter day in Florida when all of my close friends and I were standing outside a movie theater waiting. We took turns running to the bar next to the movie theater for bathroom breaks, water, and snacks. I felt that incredible sense of community that everyone who saw the original trilogy talked about back in the 70s. It was an amazing experience I will never forget. I was finally going to have *my own* Star Wars trilogy.

Everything unraveled once Kylo Ren spoke his first line of dialogue. He sounded like a poor copy of Darth Vader, thrown into the film for fan service. I pushed aside my criticism, knowing that the original trilogy wasn’t perfect. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie wasn’t spectacular.

Non-stop callbacks, inferior clones of characters from the original trilogy, and the copied conflict that was already copied for Return of the Jedi made this movie fall flat for me. At first, I thought it was me being too critical of a franchise I grew up with; I struggled to watch it in one setting when it released on Blu-ray. After three attempts to watch the film again, I decided the new direction for the series wasn’t for me.

While I still have hope that the Last Jedi will turn the series around and pull me back in, it isn’t looking very promising. From all of the pre-press information and interviews, this sounds like another carbon copy of the original series. My biggest hope when Disney announced a continuation of the original series was that we would see new characters, conflicts, and settings that were fresh and built off of what was already in the franchise. 

Unfortunately, since this doesn’t seem to be the strategy for Disney, I decided to turn to a part of the Star Wars franchise I had mostly ignored growing up, the Extended Universe. (When Disney bought Lucasfilm they changed the name of  the Extended Universe to Legends, but I strongly disagree with that decision, so I will still call it the Extended Universe)

# The Extended Universe

I distinctly remember seeing the endless shelves of Star Wars books at the public library or Barnes and Noble. Since the original trilogy was enough for me as a kid, I never jumped into that world of Star Wars. Now, with no satisfying Star Wars stories being told on the silver screen, besides Rogue One which wasn’t half bad, I decided to jump into the EU for new stories and characters.

The EU has everything you would ever want from the Star Wars franchise including numerous books, comics, and some rather good video games. Some of the stories in the EU are so well written, Disney is already pulling from them as is the case with the introduction of Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels.

# Books

The most vibrant area of the EU is the countless books published during the past two decades. No matter what aspect of the Star Wars franchise you love, there is a high chance that a book, or series of books, were published by Lucasfilm. Everything from Rogue Squadron, to Boba Fett stories, have been published and builds upon the original trilogy. 

A great jumping on point for the EU is the Thrawn trilogy of novels by Timothy Zahn. These books take place immediately after the events in Return of the Jedi and build off of the ending of the original trilogy. Before the purchase of Lucasfilm by Disney, these three novels were considered the “Authorized continuation of the legendary Star Wars saga.” 

Zahn’s writing captures the excitement and awe of the Star Wars franchise and successfully builds upon its foundation with the introduction of new characters and lore. The biggest additions to the Star Wars franchise in this series is the introduction of the cunning Grand Admiral Thrawn. His advanced military training, coupled with his logic oriented decisions make him one of the greatest adversaries Luke and his friends have ever had to fight.

# Comics

Lucasfilm has been publishing comics exploring the vast reaches of the Star Wars universe ever since A New Hope. Most of these comics were published by Dark Horse, and are now collected in handy omnibus collections available both physically, and digitally. All of these comic series is packed with new stories and characters that build on the Star Wars franchise we all know and love.

One of the first comics I remember receiving as a kid was Enemy of the Empire. I only had the final issue of the four part miniseries, but I read that issue cover to cover countless times.

While Boba Fett never captured my attention in the original trilogy, the story is very well written and includes a glimpse into the life of Boba Fett and Darth Vader before the events of A New Hope. As with most Star Wars comics, the art compliments the fantastic writing and feels like a Star Wars film.

The story arc builds out the relationship Darth Vader had with Boba Fett before the events of A New Hope and concluded with an incredible battle between the two characters. If you are interested in the life of bounty hunters in the Star Wars universe or are just a fan of Darth Vader and Boba Fett, this is an excellent introduction to the EU comics.

# Video Games

Lucasfilm over the years had their fair share of hits and misses when it came to Star Wars branded video games. Titles such as Battlefront and Rogue Squadron were great games that saw wild success and still have a devoted following to this day.

For me, the best Star Wars EU game is still Shadows of the Empire for the Nintendo 64. While the game mechanics and controls did not age well, the story is amazing. Set between the events of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Shadows of the Empire tells the story of the search for Han Solo after he is frozen in carbonite.

As with the Thrawn trilogy of novels, Shadows of the Empire introduces another fascinating villain, Prince Xizor. His plot to overthrown Darth Vader, and replace him as the Emperor's right hand, is captivating and unique. Every level of the game takes place in a well-known part of the Star Wars universe, as well as a few new locations.

The Star Wars EU is a vibrant piece of the franchise that builds and improves on the original trilogy. Stories introduce complex and unique villains and characters that are at times, better than the ones explored in the film franchise. Whether you a disappointed with Disney’s new direction, or want new stories to captivate and entertain you, the Star Wars EU is the best place for you to explore.
