Splatoon 2 barely peaked my interest when it was announced for the Switch. I skipped the demo Nintendo released a month before the launch, thinking it wasn’t for me with its kiddie aesthetic. Even though I love shooters like Halo and Doom, Splatoon 2 looked too frantic for me to be able to keep up with from the let’s plays I had seen.

When launch day for Splatoon 2 came, I went against my initial judgment and bought the game. For the first time, I had a small group of friends who were dying to play a multiplayer game together. This helped solve one of my biggest complaints I have with online multiplayer games, playing with random players from the community and not being able to coordinate between everyone.

Another big reason was that my Switch games library was very small. Up until Splatoon 2, I had only three games I would play on the Switch; all of which I was already getting worn out playing. I loved my Switch and wanted to play any game I could on it, even if I wasn’t amazed by the trailers.

I purchased Splatoon 2 with little to no expectations. After my first match, the game hooked me. For almost a solid three weeks Splatoon 2 took over my life. Every day I would jump into the lobby, trying to catch a few matches in the morning before I went to work.

All my friends and I would talk about was trying to improve our win-loss ratio, or debating which weapon we thought was the best. I checked the Switch app nonstop throughout the day, trying not to miss any of the shirts and hats that were released when I was away from my Switch. When I missed the awesome leather jacket, I was agitated for not being on the ball to grab it.

The game shattered my expectations. The fast paced three-minute matches were a blast. Even the unique clothing and modification system, which I was expecting to hate, was straightforward and fun.

Unfortunately, after three weeks, my love of Splatoon 2 started to crack. Even though I was playing anytime I could during the day, I never matched the amount of skill and hours many of the other players had devoted.

Not long after the second week, I was competing with people almost ten levels above me. My win-loss ratio dropped drastically, and every day I struggled to keep it above 3.0.

I took a break for a few days to focus on writing and work. The urge to play eventually came back but was quickly squashed when I signed back on. Other players were leaps and bounds above my level, yet I was still matched against them.

I switched to playing support for my team, focusing on painting every inch of the map I could while avoiding the opposing team at all costs. While this was fun for a while, it never had a significant impact on the match, causing my team to lose non-stop.

After a few days of struggling, I gave up and stopped playing. I returned to my PS4, with Crash Bandicoot Remastered and Horizon Zero Dawn, leaving my Switch in its dock waiting for a new game to be released to pull me back in.

Now a month later, the Splatoon 2 icon is still on my Switch home screen. I scroll past it whenever I’m looking for another game to play, hoping to open it one day and relive the initial excitement I had for the game.

Part of me is dying to go back to Splatoon 2, with its vibrant colors and slick shooting mechanics. Unfortunately, until matchmaking is balanced I still can’t enjoy the game. I’m hoping if Nintendo wants Splatoon 2 to be their flagship online shooter for the Switch, they need to get at least the basics of matchmaking correct.
